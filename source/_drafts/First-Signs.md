Jey walked into the break room, his coffee mug in hand. <!-- more --> Last minute sun rays glowed through the room's tinted windows. This late in the day, the light's slow decay was almost noticable. He approached his locker and touched his hand against it's handle. Immediately recognizing his familiar skin, the locker softly clicked open. Inside was a bag of coffee beans, several TV dinners, and a six pack of soda. He grabbed the coffee and closed the locker door.

The coffee beans tinkled as he poured them into his grinder. This was the only sound in the room, save the light footsteps of the humanoid robot behind him. "May", he called out. The footsteps paused for a moment and a gentle feminin voice responded. "Yes Jey?"

"May, did you realized our names rhyme?" Before she could answer, Jey started up the grinder. It buzzed with a moderate din. May turned her plastic body to face Jey, and patiently waited for the noise to stop. As the grinder slowed, she continued with her answer.

"I suppose it hadn't occured to me" she said politely. She paused for a moment to await his response, but Jey was busy packing an espresso machine with his fresh grinds. As a moment passed without his awknowledgement, she turned back to moving about the room.

The espresso machine fizzled as it dripped the coffee into Jey's mug. He watched it with eyes tired from a long days work. Regular hours could be demanding, but overtime was stretching Jey thin. He had been called in hours before sunrise to fix an important issue and was still searching for the remedy. As the sunlight continued to fade, he wondered how much longer the solution would elude him.

The beep of a toaster oven caught his attention. "Are you making yourself some dinner May?" he said plainly. It was a second or two before Mey responded. "I'm not hungry." Jey peeked over his shoulder at what the robot was doing.

One by one, May was closing the ajar oven doors, left open by distracted employees after warming their lunches. There was a grace to her movements, but a silence that betrayed her to lifelessness. Our natural slow pulse of breath was replaced by a soft blue light on her upper back, gently dimming and then growing back to it's origin vibrance, over and over again.

"I'm resetting these ovens to their original state" said May as a matter of fact. "I'm completing their cycle." The espresso machine hissed steam out of its spout, signifying the end of its brewing, and Jey echoed the sound in an exhale of relief. He turned back to his coffee mug, filling the rest with warm water.

"Also known as tidying up?" Jey said with a hint of amusement in his voice. "Who's got you talking like a philosopher?" May, once again, paused to respond to Jey. "If you are refering to the fact that I'm vocalizing these thought patterns, Lee integrated an expansion to my expression module."

Jey picked up his coffee mug and stepped towards the door. He paused before exiting the room. "So you were always thinking this way huh?"

"Why yes" replied May. "The idea of a cycle is one of the basic models I've applied to my surroundings for quite some time. I can even see a cycle in you Jey." The door immediately closed as Jey left the room. This prompted to May that Jey wasn't interested in what she was saying, so she discontinued her expression of thought and returned to "tidying up" the room.
