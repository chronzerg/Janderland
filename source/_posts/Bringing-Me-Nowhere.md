Mary brings me to my resonate frequency. <!-- more --> She brings me to a peace amongst the vibrations of experience. I stop to live in nothing but the movement of my breath and the waves of my blood; the perfect emptiness of life. It&#8217;s here where I sit for a moment or two, which turns to three. I waste my drive for tomorrow. And I finally love the rat race as I stop to look from afar.
